## Simple Full-Stack Chat App

This project was built as part of a school assignment to explore full-stack web development fundamentals.


### Tech Stack

HTML / CSS

Vanilla JavaScript

Axios (HTTP requests)

Socket.io (real-time communication)

Node.js backend (Express + Socket.io)


### Features

User registration and login

Basic cookie-based session handling

Real-time chat using WebSockets

Simple client-side authentication check


### What I Practiced

Client–server architecture

REST API communication

WebSocket event-driven programming

DOM manipulation

Basic authentication flow

Handling async operations (Promises / async–await)


### Notes

This project was built for learning purposes and does not implement production-level security (e.g., JWT, secure session management, password hashing improvements, etc.).


### Purpose

The goal of this project was to understand how frontend and backend systems interact, how real-time communication works, and how authentication flows are structured at a foundational level.
